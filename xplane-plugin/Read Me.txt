iX-Yoke

This is an X-Plane plugin and an iPhone app that lets you use the iPhone as a remote control yoke for X-Plane.

The X-Plane plugin acts as a server, to which the iPhone app sends commands.  This is currently implemented simply as a UDP socket with no verification or connection acknowledgement.


TODO
----

* Double-tap tilt trackpad to set tilt center.  Is this a good idea?  Maybe only while hold is on?  Or slowly move center to the new location, to allow user to adjust tilt as it moves?
* Make server update on every flight loop instead of a fixed rate (10Hz)?
* Send instrument readings back to iPhone for display?
* On plugin side, allow selection of the auxilliary y axis control.
    - Throttle
    - Helicopter collective
    - Others?
    - This will simplify the phone code since it can blindly send the extra axis without figuring out what it's controlling.
    - One downside is that, if we do this on the phone-side, we can have controls that auto-snap to center and the like.  Is this worthwhile?
    - Also allow specifying ALL axes, including tilt.  Then it could be used in tandem with a real joystick.
* Add a switch to auto-coordinate roll and yaw.  Switch on server-side.
* Tap-down visual confirmation of trackpad.
* Auditory feedback of tap-drag for better blind interaction.
* Change color/sound to alert when tilt exceeds tracking bounds.
* Distinct visual style for calibration vs control trackpads to avoid confusion.
* Eye candy: background images, pulsating trackpad dot...etc.
* ZeroConf server discovery.
