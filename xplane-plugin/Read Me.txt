This is an X-Plane plugin and an iPhone app that lets you use the iPhone as a remote control yoke for X-Plane.

The X-Plane plugin acts as a server, to which the iPhone app sends commands.  This is currently implemented simply as a UDP socket with no verification or connection acknowledgement.

### Plugin ###

* Make server update on every flight loop instead of a fixed rate (20Hz)?
* Auto-coordinate roll+yaw should move nosewheel steering more.
* Send instrument readings back to iPhone for display?
* Bonjour
