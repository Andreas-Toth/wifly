    <p>Wi-Fly is a remote control app for <i>X-Plane</i> by Laminar Research (unaffiliated).  In order to use this app, you must have a copy of X-Plane on your desktop computer and install the Wi-Fly plugin.  Your iPhone or iPod Touch must be connected via Wi-Fi to the same network as your computer.</p>
    <p>To install the Wi-Fly plugin, point your desktop browser to
    <a href="http://danieldickison.com/wifly">http://danieldickison.com/wifly</a>
    and follow the instructions under <i>Downloads</i>.</p>
    
    <hr/>
    <p>Once you have the plugin installed in X-Plane, you should see the following window when you start X-Plane:</p>
    <img src="plugin-window.png" alt="Plugin Window"/>
    <p>On the remote, you must enter one of the <b>Host IP(s)</b> listed in the plugin window, as well as the <b>Server Port</b> if it differs.  If there is more than one IP address listed, try each if the first one doesn't work.</p>
    <p>Once the correct IP and port are entered, you should see the bars in the plugin window moving as you tilt your iPhone or iPod Touch.</p>
