iX-Yoke

This is an X-Plane plugin and an iPhone app that lets you use the iPhone as a remote control yoke for X-Plane.

The X-Plane plugin acts as a server, to which the iPhone app sends commands.  This is currently implemented simply as a UDP socket with no verification or connection acknowledgement.


TODO
----

* Make server update on every flight loop instead of a fixed rate (10Hz)?
* Auto-coordinate roll+yaw should move nosewheel steering more.
* Tap-down visual confirmation of trackpad.
* Auditory feedback of tap-drag for better blind interaction.
* Change color/sound to alert when tilt exceeds tracking bounds.
* Distinct visual style for calibration vs control trackpads to avoid confusion.
* Eye candy: background images, pulsating trackpad dot...etc.
* ZeroConf server discovery, or at least show server IP in window.
* Make the "i" button easier to hit and show settings view if no IP specified on startup.


Future Ideas
-----------

* Center and bounds ideas:
    - Two-finger drag for additional axes, e.g. 3-D cockpit panning.
    - Double-tap to re-center, or for tilt, set tilt center.
    - Double-tap to set current value as the tilt center?
* Send instrument readings back to iPhone for display?
