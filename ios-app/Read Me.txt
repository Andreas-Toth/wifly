This is an X-Plane plugin and an iPhone app that lets you use the iPhone as a remote control yoke for X-Plane.

The X-Plane plugin acts as a server, to which the iPhone app sends commands.  This is currently implemented simply as a UDP socket with no verification or connection acknowledgement.

### App ###

* Center and bounds ideas:
    - Two-finger drag for additional axes, e.g. 3-D cockpit panning.
    - Double-tap to re-center, or for tilt, set tilt center.
    - Double-tap to set current value as the tilt center?
    - Option to auto-spring back to center.
    - Null-zone
* Change color/sound to alert when tilt exceeds tracking bounds.
* Auditory feedback of tap-drag for better blind interaction.
* Eye candy: background images, pulsating trackpad dot...etc.
* Landscape mode with multiple trackpads or buttons
